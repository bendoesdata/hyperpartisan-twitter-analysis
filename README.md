# hyperpartisan-twitter-analysis


<h1>Description</h1>
<p><a href="http://igor.gold.ac.uk/~bcool001/portfolio/hyperpartisan/index.html">How hyperpartisan publishers are tapping into Twitter</a> is a Twitter analysis and data vis story for the MSc Digital Journalism course at Goldsmiths, University of London. </p>

<h1>Data</h1>
<p>I scraped data from Twitter using Python (code in twitter_follow_acct.py). The scraper ran for just over 3 days, over the period of a weekend. Methodology is described in the text of the story.

View the the data in this <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B93cAgMtISXRU0x1ZmNuMW1uRTg">Google sheet</a>. The spreasheet is sorted into pivot tables summarising the data, but there's also a sheet that has the raw data from the scraped tweets. 
</p>

<h1>Visualizations</h1>
<p>Data vis was made using Highcharts.js library. Web page built with Uikit. </p>
